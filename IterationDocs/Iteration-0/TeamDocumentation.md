#### Summary

##### Shared Grocery List Website Planning

The team discussed creating a shared grocery list website, with **Tuck** explaining that **Dan**
had the overall vision but was unavailable to provide more details. **Tuck** outlined the
initial scope would focus on basic functionality like user login, updating user
information, and dynamic grocery list updates. The team agreed to meet after class to plan
their actions and ticket assignments, with **Tuck** noting some scheduling constraints due to
rugby practice.

##### Scrum Roles and Project Timeline

The team discussed their upcoming project management approach, with **Tuck** taking the Scrum
Master role for the first week and **Dan** serving as Product Owner. They agreed to start
their project weeks on Tuesdays, with the Scrum Master's week ending on Tuesday before the
next Scrum Master begins on Wednesday. The team also decided to add **Erin** to their Jira
board, which **Dan** had already set up.

##### Story Assignments and Deadlines

**Tuck** assigned story actions to team members, with **Erin** taking the first three items and
**Christian** handling the next two plus an additional task. **Erin** agreed to take on three
stories and requested guidance, which **Tuck** provided by referencing the agenda and Conestra
format. **Christian** suggested adding a story about connecting two users, which **Tuck** approved
as necessary for the next step. The team agreed to complete their assigned stories by
midnight the following day.

##### Jira and Git Integration Planning

The team discussed using Jira for story management and Git integration. **Erin** offered to
set up the Jira-Git connection and agreed to share storyboards with the team for feedback
before posting them in Jira. **Tuck** planned to add **Erin** to the Jira team and follow up with
**Dan** about access. They also decided to post storyboards in chat for initial review before
formal submission.

##### Storyboard Planning and Division

Tuck, Christian, and **Erin** discussed the project's mock-ups and storyboards, focusing on
completing them ahead of time to ensure readiness for the next iteration. **Tuck** explained
the basic requirements for the storyboards, emphasizing functionality over styling, and
suggested dividing the work between team members. **Christian** and **Erin** agreed to collaborate
on creating the storyboards, with **Christian** taking the lead on researching and completing
them, while **Erin** offered to assist and learn the process. They decided to use a simple
user interface with fields like email, first name, last name, and password. **Tuck** noted
that he would be less available due to his midterm but would provide feedback when
possible.

##### Project Planning and Development Strategy

The team discussed their approach to the project, focusing on creating a storyboard and
app skeleton. **Tuck** suggested using a Spring template as the basis for
their app skeleton, noting that **Dan** has expertise in Spring and the team has experience
with it from previous homework assignments. The team agreed to use the template, modify
the database layer, and share the repository among the four of them. **Tuck** emphasized that
their initial submission on Tuesday hasn't set their course in stone since **Dan** 
was busy and couldn't meet but should demonstrate their effort and direction.

##### Project Template Setup Discussion

The team discussed using a template for their new project, agreeing to start with a class
template unless instructed otherwise by their instructor. **Tuck** will fork the template and
set it up on Tuesday for submission, with the option to switch to an instructor-provided
repository if requested. **Christian** and **Erin** plan to work on the project on Monday
afternoon after 3 PM, with **Christian** focusing on user-related stories that require Erin's
information.

##### Team Backgrounds and Expertise

The team discussed their professional backgrounds, with **Erin** sharing her 16+ years of QA
experience and **Tuck** detailing his extensive work in embedded development, kernel work, and
hardware engineering. They discovered they had previously worked at the same companies and
knew mutual contacts, creating a connection between them.
